# M-M-1-Queue-Simulation
M/M/1 queue model is a single server queue model with exponential arrival and service times.

M/M/1 queue system is a single server queue system with exponential arrivals and service time. 
This simulation code calculates arrival and departing times of total number of people in queue which is given as input.
Calculations for first few customers are removed as the warm up period.
